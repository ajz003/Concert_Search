# Concert_Search

Hey team!

So the following are the things Pierre and I discussed today - we'll go over them further on Wednesday the 5th to make sure we're all on the same page and everyone has an equal input/say in the project (let alone the fact that we're not entirely sure what other stipulations we'll receive from Clark first).


API's we'd like to pull from:
- YouTube
- Ticketmaster
- Google Maps
- BandsInTown
- Spotify
(possible)  - live streaming
            - hotels.com
            - twitter

They should all be free to get a key for, but we can just post the key's on here for shared usage.


Our BASIC functions:
- map with pins (that possibly get bigger)
        - ability to search by genre, location, artists, dates, location (including multiple)
- a pop-up over the left side "results" bar
        - making it look nice
        - audio piece from one of their popular songs, video capability, band image, short description, website link

Optional ADVANCED functions:
- login page with app info (dressed up)
        - login, password, etc.
        - doesn't have to actually work (since we don't have back-end)
- save information to local storage
- when the map is moved around, automatically adjusts and repopulates results
- livestreaming to watch concerts/whatever in real time
- paying for tickets through the site
        - seperate popup for stadium seating map
- twitter feed for band
- show hotels in the area
- show "next" __ results (button)
